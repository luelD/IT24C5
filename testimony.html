               <h1>Testimony</h1>
               <h2>Throughout the process of creating our website using HTML and Visual Studio Code (VS Code), I gained valuable knowledge and skills that significantly improved my understanding of web development. This project involved more than just building pages; it was about learning how to structure and organize content in a meaningful way.<br> </br>

                Initially, I learned how to construct the basic structure of a webpage using HTML. Starting with the Home Page, I became familiar with creating headings and paragraphs. I discovered how each element contributes to the overall look and feel of a website, emphasizing the importance of structuring content in a clear and accessible manner.<br> </br>
                
                A key learning point was mastering the use of tags and attributes in HTML. By applying different tags, I realized how crucial these elements are in defining the content of each webpage. Additionally, I understood how attributes like class and id are used to apply styles and make sections interactive, enhancing both functionality and visual appeal.<br>
                
                Working with VS Code was another significant aspect of this project. I learned the importance of using an efficient code editor. Features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion streamlined the coding process, while the integrated terminal enabled us to test our website and identify errors quickly.<br> </br>
                
                Managing all the pages on the website, taught me how to effectively structure content and create a user-friendly layout. I developed skills in organizing information, applying HTML tags and attributes, and utilizing tools like VS Code for efficient coding and design.<br> </br>
                
                Overall, this project provided me with not only technical skills in HTML and web development but also crucial insights into structuring, designing, and creating a user-centric website. Building a website from scratch was both challenging and rewarding, giving me a solid foundation to build upon in the future.</h2>
